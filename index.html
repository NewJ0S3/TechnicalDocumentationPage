            <header>Java and JavaScript</header>
            <article>
                <p>Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages with different purposes, despite their similar names. Here are the key differences between Java and JavaScript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language primarily used for building server-side applications, desktop applications, mobile apps (Android), and large-scale enterprise systems.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for client-side web development, enabling interactive features and dynamic content on websites. It's also commonly used for server-side development (Node.js) and desktop application development (Electron).</li>
                    <li>Java is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are explicitly declared at compile time. It follows a class-based object-oriented programming paradigm.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. It follows a prototype-based object-oriented programming paradigm.</li>
                    <li>Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java code can run on any device or platform that has a JVM implementation.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript code is executed by a JavaScript engine, which is embedded in web browsers for client-side execution. On the server-side, JavaScript code can be executed by platforms like Node.js.</li>
                    <li>Java has a strong, static type system, which helps catch errors at compile time and provides robustness and predictability to the code.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript has a dynamic, weakly-typed type system, allowing flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors if not handled carefully.</li>
                    <li>Java syntax is similar to languages like C++ and C#, with a focus on explicit declaration of types, classes, and methods.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript syntax is influenced by C and Java but has its own unique features, such as prototypal inheritance, anonymous functions, and dynamic typing.</li>
                    <li>Java supports multithreading and provides built-in concurrency features like synchronized blocks and thread pools.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is single-threaded by nature, but it supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.</li>
                    <li>Java has a rich set of standard libraries (Java Standard Edition) and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for various purposes, such as Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Maven.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript has the Node.js runtime on the server-side, which provides access to a wide range of libraries via npm (Node Package Manager). On the client-side, it has the Document Object Model (DOM) for manipulating web pages and a thriving ecosystem of frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</li>

            <header>Hello World</header>
            <article>
                <p>To write the famous "Hello, World!" program in Java, you can follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.</li>
                    <li>Create a new Java source file with a .java extension.</li>
                    <li>Enter the following code:</li>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    public class HelloWorld {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                        }
                    }                    
                </code>
                <ol>
                    <li>Save the file with the name HelloWorld.java.</li>
                    <li>Open a command prompt or terminal.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the directory where you saved HelloWorld.java.</li>
                    <li>Compile the Java source file by running the following command:</li>
                </ol>
            </article>
            <code>
                javac HelloWorld.java
            </code>
            <ol>
                <li>If there are no syntax errors, this command will generate a bytecode file named HelloWorld.class.</li>
                <li>Run the compiled Java program by executing the following command:</li>
            </ol>
            <code>
                java HelloWorld
            </code>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. Each variable has a data type, a name, and a value. Here's an overview of variables in Java:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Declaring Variables:</b></li>
                    <p>In Java, you declare a variable by specifying its data type followed by its name:</p>
                    <code>
                        dataType variableName;
                    </code>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>
                        int age;
                        double salary;
                        String name;
                    </code>
                    <li><b>Initializing Variables</b></li>
                    <p>You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single statement:</p>
                    <code>
                        dataType variableName = value;
                    </code>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>
                        int age = 30;
                        double salary = 50000.50;
                        String name = "John Doe";
                    </code>
                    <li><b>Data Types:</b></li>
                    <p>Java has two main categories of data types: primitive types and reference types.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Primitive Types:</b> These are basic data types built into the Java language. They include:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Numeric types: byte, short, int, long, float, double</li>
                            <li>boolean: represents true or false values</li>
                            <li>char: represents a single Unicode character</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Reference Types:</b> These are objects that are instantiated from classes. Examples include String, Arrays, and objects created from user-defined classes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Variable Naming Rules:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).</li>
                        <li>After the first character, variable names can also include digits (0-9).</li>
                        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
                        <li>Variable names cannot be Java keywords.</li>
                        <li>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Constants:</b></li>
                    <p>In Java, you can declare constants using the final keyword. Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned.</p>
                    <code>
                        final dataType CONSTANT_NAME = value;
                    </code>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <code>
                        final double PI = 3.14159;
                    </code>
                    <li><b>Scope of Variables:</b></li>
                    <p>The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible. In Java, variables can have different scopes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Local Variables:</b> Declared within a method, constructor, or block. They are only accessible within the block in which they are declared.</li>
                        <li><b>Instance Variables (Fields):</b> Declared within a class but outside any method. They are accessible to all methods of the class.</li>
                        <li><b>Class Variables (Static Fields):</b> Declared with the static keyword within a class but outside any method. They are shared among all instances of the class.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here's a simple example demonstrating variable declaration, initialization, and usage in Java:</p>
                    <code>
                        public class VariablesExample {
                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                // Declaring and initializing variables
                                int age = 30;
                                double salary = 50000.50;
                                String name = "John Doe";
                                
                                // Outputting variables
                                System.out.println("Name: " + name);
                                System.out.println("Age: " + age);
                                System.out.println("Salary: $" + salary);
                                
                                // Modifying variables
                                age = 31;
                                salary = 55000.75;
                                
                                // Outputting modified variables
                                System.out.println("Updated Age: " + age);
                                System.out.println("Updated Salary: $" + salary);
                            }
                        }                        
                    </code>
